# Getting the API Key

In this project, you will access various APIs with Python and create your own API. We will start by accessing News API. To be able to follow along, you need to get a free News API following the steps below:

1. Go to [News API](https://newsapi.org/)

2. On the website, click on the **Get Api Key** button in the top right corner.

3. The above will take you to a web form. Fill in the form and press submit. The next page will show the API key. Python will need that API key to access news articles.
